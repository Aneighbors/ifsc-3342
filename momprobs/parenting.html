            <p>Moms have a lot of our plate and let’s face it sometimes we do some face palming things here is a list of some mom confessions I have heard. If you have a funny one to add please send me a comment. Because let’s be honest, we are just trying to survive the day.</p>
            <p>I dressed my child up as JoJo for Neon Day (face paint and glitter too). Neon day was next Monday.

              <p>I accidentally packed some black lingerie in my daughter’s bag thinking it was her leotard for gymnastics, didn’t figure it out till we were at the gym.

            <h2>52 Uncommon Family Adventures</h2></a>
            <h5>New Book for the Family 05/08/2023</h5>
            <div class="blog-img"><img class="blog" src="assets/img/52-family-sm.jpg" alt="52 Ideas for the family"></div>
            <p>
              I was so excited that while doing this website I found this book, I can’t wait until it arrives so that my family and I can start having adventures! My husband and I currently have 2 of the date books by this author, Randy Southern and we love them! So, I know we will like his family book as well.
              If you want to see the dating books I talk about them on the dating side of my blog, so if you want to go there click on the dating link above.

              <p>If you can't afford this book, you can always search on pinterest for ideas to do as a family. The one above is the ultimate summer bucket list for families. You can even search for completely free ideas
                There are tons of these list or you can make one up as a family.
