            <h2>Mom Problems</h2>
            <h5>Why this blog, April 4th, 2023</h5>
            <div class="blog-img"><img class="blog" src="assets/img/mom-prob2.png" alt="woman juggling life"></div>
            <p>I decided to create this blog in order to help and inspire other women, wives and/or mothers who feel like they are struggling. Are you tired and run down? Know you are not alone. Through this website I want to bring women/moms/wives together. 
              I am bringing together all of the tips that I have found useful in my crazy chaotic life. I also want to encourage you to share with me what you have found useful in your life. I am planning on using this blog to also talk about things that I have 
              done or tried off Pinterest and how it turned out for me.
