            <h2>Mom Problems</h2>
            <h5>Why this blog, April 4th, 2023</h5>
            <div class="blog-img"><img class="blog" src="assets/img/mom-prob2.png" alt="woman juggling life"></div>
            <p>I decided to create this blog to help and inspire other women, wives and/or mothers who feel like they are struggling. </p>

            <p>Are you tired and run down? Know you are not alone. </p>
              
            <p>Through this website I want to bring women/moms/wives together. I am bringing all the tips that I have found useful in my crazy chaotic life and sharing them with you. 
              I also want to encourage you to share with me what you have found useful in your life. </p>
              
            <p>I am planning on using this blog to also talk about things that I have done or tried off Pinterest and how it turned out for me.

            <h2>Passionate Penny Pincher</h2>
            <h5>My Favorite Website, May 8th, 2023</h5>
            <p>One of my favorite websites that I took some inspirations from for my website is called Passionate Penny Pincher. 
              <a class="popular" href="https://passionatepennypincher.com/">Click here to go to their website.</a> This website has recipes, DIY ideas, money saving tips and more. 
              I receive emails from them about things that are on sale, ways to save money, tips, and tricks they have discovered, recipes, you name it. I hope you enjoy this website as much as I do! I have even purchased 3 of their recipe boxes and my family so far has loved all the recipes that we have cooked. I have also bought their planner for 2 years in a row now. Their planners are beautifully made, high quality and just like their website filled with useful information. I have also saved countless of dollars from following their coupon/sales, they even will share ways to get some things for free!
