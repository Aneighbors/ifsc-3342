            <div class="blog-img"><img class="blog" src="assets/img/me&u.jpg" alt="My husband and I"></div>
            <p>So I am married, so why am I calling this section of my blog "dating" and not "marriage"? Well I am going to tell you teh secret to a happy marriage--dating! You cant 
              ever stop dating your spouse. You need to always pursue them like you did when you were dating. My husband's name is Gage, he and I had got into a rut that most married couples
              seem to fall into- we were feeling more like roomates than spouses. But why? Because life had got in the way. When your young and dating you make time to see each other, you look 
              forward to seeing each other, talking to each other. But when the stresses of everyday life gets in the way its easy to out your partner on the backburner. But this should never
              be the case. Your partner is your one and only. You need to make time for each other even if its just one night a month. Never stop dating. In my next blog post I am going to talk
              about two books that we have used to help make dating more spontaneous and fun.

              are written by Randy Southern, these are christian based date books that have you go on some pretty strange and unique dates, at the end of each section is a prayer.

            <p>

              Recreating our first date eleven years later. Gage wore cowboy boots and his wranglers and climbed the bronze eagle at the RiverMarket.
              We ate at Rombas on our first date, which is no longer around. So we ate at Diablos which is the same location.
              On our first date Gage got on the River Front Amphitheater and sang me "You are my Sunshine" we weren't able to get there because it was fenced off. He stood by the fence and sang it to me really loud, and I joined in.

              We are finally able to resume our 52 date adventures. We had been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and were unable to really go out. This was the cemetery date, and a very emotional date. We took flowers to Owen and my granny's graves.

              First Impressions,so for this date we had to make a dating profile for the other person. We also took pictures of ourselves that we would use for our dating profile picture.
              I am a hard working man who with a little help does very well with my finances. My daughter is my world, I love buying her new clothes and toys. When you become a part of my life I will always have your back no matter what, and always be there for you. I am a genuine, kind man that will treat you the way you should be treated. I love God and going to church. Some of my hobbies include: woodworking, hunting, shooting my bow, Crossfit, gaming, and hiking. I am an outdoors kinda guy but I can also kick it with the couch potatoes too.
              Im a young beautiful woman and a mother of a beautiful little girl. I always take care of those I love and care for needs first. I enjoy reading and the outdoors. Camping and hiking are at the top of the list. I work hard to provide and enjoy my job. I enjoy just relaxing and playing games. I have an out spoken personality and Im conservative with my money so that there is never an issue for my family but that doesnt mean I dont have fun and let loose every now and then. I have a gorgeous smile, kind eyes and a beautiful soul. I am faith full and strong in my faith. I will always be there for my baby and want what is best for her. I have a close family and my mother is my best friend I always want to be close to her. I am fun and caring woman that is kind and sweet.

            <p>If you have Pinterest you can find all kinds of lists of different date ideas, such as the one pictured above. If its summer you can search list of summer date ideas on Pinterest. 
              So many will come up, pick one you like and start marking off the dates! One date idea that I found that we havent tried yet is a Progressive Dinner date-have an appetizer at one restaurant, an entr√©e at another restaurant and then dessert at another. 
              If you have any fun date ideas I would love to hear from you!
