            <h2>Dating</h2>
            <h5>Why Date? 05/03/2023</h5>

            <p>So, I am married, so why am I calling this section of my blog "dating" and not "marriage"? Well, I am going to tell you the secret to a happy marriage--dating! You can’t ever stop dating your spouse. You need to always pursue them like you did when you were dating. My husband and I had got into a rut that most married couples seem to fall into- we were feeling more like roommates than spouses. But why? Because life had got in the way. When you’re young and dating you make time to see each other, you look forward to seeing each other, talking to each other. But when the stress of everyday life gets in the way it’s easy to put your partner on the backburner. But this should never be the case. Your partner is your one and only. You need to make time for each other even if it’s just one night a month. Never stop dating. In my next blog post, I am going to talk about two books that we have used to help make dating more spontaneous and fun.

            <h5>Dating My spouse, February 24th, 2020</h5>

            <p>Above are two date books that my husband and I started February 24th, 2020. Unfortunately, Covid hit and messed up the streak we had going. I hope soon to start where we left off. These two books are written by Randy Southern; these are Christian based date books that have you go on some strange and unique dates. At the end of each section is a prayer.
            </p>
            <p>The following is a list of some of the dates that we have done from the books so far.
              
            </p>
            <h3>February 24th, 2020</h3>
            <p>

              Recreating our first date eleven years later. Gage wore cowboy boots and his wranglers and climbed the bronze eagle at the River Market just like he did on our first date. We ate at Rombas on our first date, which is no longer around. So, instead we ate at Diablos which is in the same location that Rombas used to be. On our first date Gage got on the River Front Amphitheater stage and sang "You are my Sunshine" to me at the top of his lungs. We couldn’t get to the stage this time because it was fenced off. Instead, he stood by the fence and sang it to me really loud, and I joined in. </p>
            <h3>March 1st, 2020</h3>
            <p>
              
              This date was to go somewhere you hadn’t been before on a date, and at the time we hadn’t ever been to North Little Rock for a date. We went to McCain mall, Burns Park, to a new restaurant, Black Bear Diner, then to Ollie's and on the way home we stopped at Bass Pro. Lorelei, our daughter accompanied us on this date, and we all had a blast. It was also fun to eat somewhere new.</p>
              <h3>March 6th, 2020</h3>
              <p>
                Date 3 was called "A chauffeured date." For this date we had a morning date, we got up went to eat at breakfast at Chick-fil-a, then Gage dropped me off at work and picked me up later that evening, so I didn’t drive that day at all. </p>
              <h3>August 23rd, 2020</h3>
              <p>
                We are finally able to resume our 52 date adventures. We had been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and were unable to really go out. This was the cemetery date, and a very emotional date. We took flowers to the graves of my nephew Owen and to my granny.</p>
              <h3>August 29th, 2020</h3>
              <p>
                First Impressions, so for this date we had to make a dating profile for the other person. We also took pictures of ourselves that we would use for our dating profile picture. This wasn’t for a real website, just a fun thing to do to see what the other thinks of you. 
              </p>
              <p>This is what I wrote about Gage: “I am a hardworking man who with a little help does very well with my finances. My daughter is my world, I love buying her new clothes and toys. When you become a part of my life, I will always have your back no matter what, and always be there for you. I am a genuine, kind man that will treat you the way you should be treated. I love God and going to church. Some of my hobbies include woodworking, hunting, shooting my bow, CrossFit, gaming, and hiking. I am an outdoors kind of guy, but I can also kick it with the couch potatoes too.” </p>
              <p></p>This is what he wrote about me: “I’m a beautiful young woman and a mother of a beautiful little girl. I always take care of those I love and care for. I enjoy reading and the outdoors. Camping and hiking are at the top of the list. I work hard to provide for my family and enjoy my job. I enjoy just relaxing and playing games. I have an outspoken personality and I’m conservative with my money so that there is never an issue for my family but that doesn’t mean I don’t have fun and let loose every now and then. I have a gorgeous smile, kind eyes and a beautiful soul. I am faithful and strong in my faith. I will always be there for my baby and want what is best for her. I have a close family and my mother is my best friend. I always want to be close to her. I am fun and caring woman that is kind and sweet.”

                Dance Date- Gage and I aren’t big on dancing, so we decided to do a dance workout on the Beachbody app, it was a fun and sweaty date!

            <p>If you have Pinterest, you can find all kinds of lists of different date ideas, such as the one pictured above. If it’s summer, you can search list of summer date ideas on Pinterest. So many will come up, pick one you like and start marking off the dates! 
              </p>
              <p>One date idea that I found that we haven’t tried yet is a Progressive Dinner date-have an appetizer at one restaurant, an entrée at another restaurant and then dessert at another. </p>
              <p>If you have any fun date ideas, I would love to hear from you!
