                        Human-Computer Interaction, or HCI, is a discipline traditionally devoted to the study and 
                        creation of computer products that help users carry out tasks, focusing on the ease of use, 
                        execution time, avoidance of possible errors, and user satisfaction. HCI combines diverse 
                        areas of knowledge such as cognitive psychology, computer science, design engineering, 
                        and linguistics to develop new devices and interaction styles that incorporate people’s 
                        language capabilities into human-machine dialogue. HCI research aims to design simpler, 
                        safer, more comfortable, more reliable, and more effective systems to allow individuals 
                        to perform their activities productively with sufficient levels of “manageability”, 
                        “usability” or “friendliness”. It also addresses the design of intelligent systems and 
                        interfaces capable of emulating aspects of human behavior such as proactively assisting 
                        in problem solving, enabling more natural communication with individuals themselves, 
                        and acting autonomously in response to changes in context.

                    <p>    
                        As software becomes more sophisticated and state-of-the-art interaction technologies are 
                        incorporated into its development to provide a more natural dialogue with users and more 
                        convenient access to data, HCI research and development grows increasingly important. The 
                        EAC, as a research center with expertise in data analytics and visualization, is in the 
                        perfect position to be a partner for companies who are eager to create well thought out, 
                        designed, and developed interfaces or software applications to deliver their customers 
                        higher quality products or make their employees work better. This means not just delivering 
                        something visually appealing, enjoyable, or “cool”. It involves understanding people, the 
                        environment, and the processes to make digital tools or services that are easily manageable 
                        and provide data access and information in a more user-friendly manner.

                    <p>One of the strong suites in the EAC for development is our number of immersive visualization,
                         mixed realities, and/or interactive technologies. We have developed various types of 
                         computer simulations, training exercises, walk-throughs and interactive experiences with 
                         the use of a number of devices to engage the user.

                    <p>
                        We use augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality to help interrelate the user

                        interaction is a unique priority at the EAC in developing interactive applications. The 
                        ability to involve multiple participants into a virtual real-time environments is something 
                        that is difficult but with new technologies and networked devices we are able to immerse 
                        these participants together. Each device in our lab offers various methods for development 
                        in leveraging user experiences, engagement, and learning. These techniques help the user 
                        examine numerous strategies for learning with the resources we provide.

                        In an increasingly complex world, with growing interactions between users and cyber-systems 
                        and an ever-increasing amount of information, machine learning techniques have become a 
                        fundamental tool for the EAC. Machine learning allows for more efficient use of data and 
                        facilitates the extraction of the hidden knowledge within it. The exploitation of data, in 
                        conjunction with data visualization, allows the EAC to speed up the insights discovery 
                        process, obtain more specific and valuable information, and incorporate the knowledge 
                        generated into the analysis of new input data to produce more dynamic visualization or 
                        predictive models.

                        Beyond pure data analytics, mass data processing techniques and automatic knowledge 
                        extraction have been an unprecedented force multiplier for technological progress in recent 
                        decades, making possible the development of new channels and mechanisms of communication 
                        between humans and computer systems. In recent years, the group has focused efforts on 
                        exploring new avenues of work at the intersection of machine learning with human-computer 
                        interaction to conceive new algorithmic solutions capable of recognizing and understanding 
                        both the activity and behavior of users (e.g., hand gesture recognition, body pose 
                        estimation, gaze tracking), as well as the different phenomena surrounding them to extract 
                        context-adapted knowledge (e.g., object detection, image recognition) and provide more 
                        efficient support for repetitive, tedious or highly complex processes.

                    <p>During the last decade, progress in telecommunications and the continued miniaturization of 
                        electronics have led to the emergence of innovations such as the internet of things (IoT) 
                        and cyber-physical systems (CPS), able to incorporate computing, communication, and even 
                        “smart” features, into ordinary objects such as appliances or cars. This technological 
                        revolution has had a tremendous effect, and terms such as smart home, smart car, and smart 
                        city are part of the everyday vocabulary of millions of people. Methods and technologies 
                        developed under the IoT paradigm facilitate communication and data exchange among the 
                        different devices that comprise intelligent environments, enabling the creation and 
                        exploitation of new network architectures based on connected sensing instruments and 
                        resource-constrained energy-efficient end devices (i.e., embedded devices and mobile devices). 
                        Efforts made have primarily been aimed at the design and deployment of faster and more 
                        efficient network infrastructures, as well as the development of more accurate sensing 
                        platforms and more powerful computing hardware. These systems enable the collection and storage 
                        of large volumes of data and the support of increasingly sophisticated AI techniques. In recent 
                        years, by leveraging its expertise in parallel and high-performance computing, the EAC has 
                        built solid know-how in the design of IoT solutions, exploiting today’s mobile and cloud 
                        technologies for the development of business production and training systems capable of 
                        operating in interactive environments where individuals work cooperatively, where user 
                        interfaces emerge as a key enabler element for information exchange and where communication 
                        among the people is involved. In this respect, aligned with the ubiquitous computing paradigm, 
                        the group has mainly focused on developing distributed user interfaces capable of spreading the 
                        elements of interaction between different users, different platforms or hardware configurations,
                        and different physical spaces.

                        medical data into usable information, the growing volume of patient data, an increase in technological 
                        know-how, and demand for quick and efficient healthcare processes and systems.
